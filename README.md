# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System

The movie ticket booking system allows users to book tickets according to the available show timings, ticket prices and venues of the movie. This database will hold the user details, theatre details, movie details and add data to the database as and when a user books a ticket. The system also contains triggers to alert the user about situations such as house full or if a class of seats, i.eâ€¦, gold or silver etc., has been booked completely. 
Acquiring user information will be amazingly simple while handling such databases with which data analysis can be done upon to get further insights which in turn can help in improving the quality of the service.
In the future, this system can be integrated with a front-end setup to launch a concurrent system for booking tickets across various platforms. Also, analytical graphs can be obtained with the help of the database which can then suggest to users according to their past preferences.
